All work on Neumorph UI happens directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/adrianwitaszak/neumorph-ui). Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

According to our release schedule, we maintain two branches, master and feature. If you send a bugfix pull request, please do it against the master branch, if it's a feature pull request, please do it against the feature branch.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free video series:

How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub

To help you get your feet wet and get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of good first issues that contain bugs or small features that have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started.

If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people don't accidentally duplicate your effort.
If somebody claims an issue but doesn't follow up for more than two weeks, it's fine to take over it but you should still leave a comment.

If you are an active contributor and are willing to work with Ant Design Team in our opensource workflow, you can apply to be a outside collaborator.
